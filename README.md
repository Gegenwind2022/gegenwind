<!-- ABOUT THE PROTOTYPE -->

## About the prototype

![Prototype Home Page](src/assets/screenshot.png)

This web shop prototype was built in collaboration with team Gegenwind as part of Inside StartUp course at HBKsaar. The prototype aims to develop a web shop that will introduce you to individual cycling shoes that are tailor-made and sustainable for all bike paths you will climb. You will also find out more about different shoe features, user registration and people behind the project here.

Of course, this prototype will only serve to jumpstart the fully functional web shop development in future and the final requirements may be different. So more features will be added later.
